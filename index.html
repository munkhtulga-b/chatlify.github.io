    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Chatlify ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle 
        information when you use our automated messaging service integrated with Meta platforms (Facebook/Instagram).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is designed to provide automated responses through Meta's messaging platforms. We only access 
        the minimum information necessary to provide this service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Message Content:</strong> We temporarily access messages sent to your page/account to generate 
        automated responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Profile Information:</strong> We may access your public profile information (such as 
        page name) as required by Meta's API to authenticate and operate the service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the accessed information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read incoming messages to your Meta page/account</li>
        <li>Generate and send automated responses</li>
        <li>Maintain the connection with Meta's API</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not store, save, or retain any of your data.</strong> All messages and information are 
        processed in real-time and immediately discarded after the automated response is sent. We do not maintain 
        any databases, logs, or records of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Message content</li>
        <li>User conversations</li>
        <li>Personal information</li>
        <li>Usage data or analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any data to third parties. Since we do not store any data, 
        there is nothing to share.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Meta Platform Integration</h2>
    <p>
        Our app operates through Meta's official APIs and is subject to Meta's own privacy policies and terms 
        of service. We recommend reviewing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank">Meta Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank">Meta Terms of Service</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over our app's access to your Meta account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revoke Access:</strong> You can remove our app's permissions at any time through your 
        Facebook Settings → Apps and Websites</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Since we don't store any data, there is no data to delete from 
        our systems. Revoking access immediately terminates all processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement appropriate technical measures to ensure that messages are processed securely in real-time. 
        Our integration with Meta follows their security guidelines and best practices.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information 
        from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used our service, 
        please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an 
        updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>11. International Users</h2>
    <p>
        Our service operates globally through Meta's platform. By using our app, you acknowledge that information 
        may be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless of where you are located.
